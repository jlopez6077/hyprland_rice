### My Hyprland Rice Configuration

My personal Hyprland setup and configuration files, packaged as an automated installer for Arch Linux.

## üåæ My Linux Journey

I decided that to learn Linux, I was going to install Arch. What started as a simple desktop setup quickly became an obsession with customization!
The configuration files are largely based on blank. I started with installing the packages I wanted and then Hyprland. I then found myself putting a lot of effort into customizing this setup.
I thought to myself, "What if my computer blows up and I have to do all of this over again?!" Well, that led me into the Linux rabbit hole!
I started coding up bash scripts as a way to document my progress, and now I'm here posting my rice. This is just part one - there is still so much I want to improve.
Note: This installer specifically handles the Hyprland configuration and related dotfiles, not a complete system setup.
